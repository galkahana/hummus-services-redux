Hello {{name || username}},   

Welcome to PDFHummus Services, the Cloud PDF generation service.      

This email is automated response, letting you know that your registration request was accepted.  

There is one technicality to handle before you can start calling the service from your applications - we need to determine a usage plan and payment method. 
For this purpose we will contact you soon asking a little bit about what projects you have in mind, and find out the required usage of the service.
If you wish to hasten a process (or ask questions) drop us a note at [{{supportEmail}}](mailto:{{supportEmail}}). Note your username (*{{username}}*) to help us find you.

At this point, while you are waiting for your request to be processed, you can already start creating PDF files in the console website.  
Go to [The playground]({{serviceUrl}}/console/playground) to design your PDFs. 
You should consult the [documentation]({{serviceUrl}}/documentation) to learn how to do that and what capabilities are available.

When the request is approved you will be able to create API keys and start using the service from your browser and backend applications.

 
Best of luck,    
*PDFHummus Services Team.*
